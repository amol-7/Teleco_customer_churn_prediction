# Teleco_customer_churn_prediction

# Objective:
    The objective of this project is to analyze historical data of telecom customers and develop a predictive model to identify factors contributing to customer churn and predict potential churners. By understanding the key drivers of churn, the goal is to provide actionable insights to reduce churn rate and improve customer retention strategies.
    
## Dataset Info:
    DataSet containing Telco customer data and showing customers left last month
This data contains 7043 rows and 21 columns

##### What is churn :
 - Churn is a key driver of EBITDA margin and an industry-wide challenge.
 - A churned customer provides less revenue or zero revenue and increases competitor market share. 
 - It costs  up to 5 times as much for an Service Provider to acquire a new subscriber as to retain an existing one

#### What is EBITDA
 - EBITDA stands for =>> Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization
 - EBITDA measures a company's revenues
#### How it is calculated
######    EBITDA = E + I + T + D + A
     - E  =	net income
     - I  =	interest
     - T  =	taxes
     - D  =	depreciation (Amount of asset value lost over time.)
     - A  =	amortization (Decreasing an assets cost over a period of time.)

## Technique used for balancing the data
 - SMOTE-ENN (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Edited Nearest Neighbors) is
   a combination of two techniques: 
     - SMOTE (for over-sampling the minority class) and 
     - ENN (Edited Nearest Neighbors, for under-sampling both classes). 
 - SMOTE-ENN is designed to address class imbalance in binary classification problems.
